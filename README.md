# Map Crasher
This is a very stupid spigot plugin that gives a map with 400 000 cursors on it after doing /getmap

**Do not use this plugin for illegal purposes. This plugin was done purely to experience the lag.** 

PS: You need to restart the server to have the plugin working. Reloads will not work.
